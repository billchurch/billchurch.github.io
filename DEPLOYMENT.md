# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This site is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - Triggers on pushes to `master` or `main` branch
   - Builds the project using `npm run build`
   - Deploys the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages

2. **No Manual Build Required**:
   - Simply push your changes to the master branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

## Initial Setup (One-time)

### Configure GitHub Pages Settings:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the changes

### First Deployment:

1. Push this workflow file to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. The workflow will run automatically
3. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to monitor progress
4. Once complete, your site will be live at https://billchurch.github.io

## Subsequent Deployments

Just push to master:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin master
```

The site will automatically rebuild and deploy!

## Local Development

For local testing:
```bash
npm run dev      # Development server
npm run build    # Build locally to test
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Important Notes

- The `dist/` folder is in `.gitignore` - it should NOT be committed
- GitHub Actions handles the build process
- CNAME file in `public/` ensures custom domain (if used) persists
- The workflow uses Node.js 20 to match your local environment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab in GitHub for error messages
2. Ensure `npm ci` and `npm run build` work locally
3. Verify GitHub Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. Check that the workflow has proper permissions (configured in the workflow file)
